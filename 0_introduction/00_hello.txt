Hey welcome to words, numbers, and lists.

Why is this called Words, Numbers, and Lists instead of python training?

Great question! The idea is that you if you already know words (strings), numbers (integers, numeric), and lists (lists, dictionaries, sets), then you have 80% of the knowledge.


This course gives you the other 10% of python knowledge.


And you'll gain the other 10% by google + trial/error.


Focus areas.

How to create a virtual environment (5%)
    Should I use venv or conda?
        Venv has more support
        Conda gives you more control
    Some people use conda, I personally use venv. Use whatever is comfortable for you!

    Why use a virtual environment?
    Each project gets it's own house, you want to keep each projects dependencies and workflow bundled together

How to install packages in your virtual environment (5%)
    For every project you install numpy (np) and pandas (pd)
    Do not deviate from these naming conventions. That's a hard rule!
